## `elte` monorepo – university materials

This repo is the central place for all important **university / ELTE** materials.  
It contains the code, assignments and exams (ZHs) for web programming, web development and teacher‑training courses across multiple semesters.

### Structure in short – what this folder is about

- At the root level you have **semester folders**:
  - `2025-26-1/`, `2025-26-2/`, `2025-2/`, `2025-1/`, `2024-2/`, `2024-1/`, `2023-2/`, `2023-1/`, `2022-2/`, `2022-1/`, `2021-2/`, …
- Inside a semester there are **course folders**:
  - `webprog/`, `webfejlesztes/`, `tanarszak/`, and possibly others.
- Inside a course folder:
  - `assignments/` – homework / projects, with starter kits
  - `zh/` – written tests, group tests
  - `misc/` – other materials

Concrete examples:

- `2026-1/` – the current academic year’s autumn semester, with course folders like `advanced-webprog`, `awp-3`, `awp-4`, `awp-5`, `kliens-5`.
- `2025-2/`, `2025-1/`, … – full material for earlier web programming / web development semesters.
- The `*.md` files in the root (e.g. `MIGRATION.md`, `monorepos.md`, `archive-strategy.md`) document your overall GitHub structure.
